# Udacity-Build-a-Portfolio-Site ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Statue-Close-red.svg)
This repository is the code for the "Build a Portfolio Site" project from Udacity.

I am planning to develop a dynamically available portfolio site using NodeJS and Express framework in the future. When development is complete, the GIthub repository or this README.md file will be updated.

# Demo
Currently, this web page is hosted using the GitHub Pages feature because it is a site developed solely using static files.
